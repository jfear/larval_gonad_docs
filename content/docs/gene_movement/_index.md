## Gene Movement

We are interested in the evolutionary impact of X inactivation. 
There are several hypotheses about why the X would evolve MSCI during spermatogenesis. 
Here we are focusing on the idea that if the X is really silenced during spermatogenesis, then genes important for male fertility should move off of the X.
During Drosophila genus development there was a fusion of Muller element A (X) with Muller element D (3L) in *D. pseudoobscura* (**Figure 1**).
